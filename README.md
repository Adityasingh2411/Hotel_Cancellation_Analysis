# 🏬Hotel_Cancellation_Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes hotel booking data to uncover patterns behind booking cancellations, helping hotels reduce lost revenue and improve customer retention. The study covers two types of hotels — City Hotel and Resort Hotel — and investigates how customer behavior, booking channels, and lead times influence cancellations.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify which hotel type faces higher cancellation rates.

- Analyze the impact of lead time on cancellations.
  
- Study cancellations by market segment and distribution channel.

- Examine seasonal trends in bookings and cancellations.

- Provide recommendations for hotels to minimize cancellations.

❓ Key Questions

Which hotel type has the highest cancellation rate?

How does lead time (days between booking & arrival) affect cancellations?

Do online travel agencies (OTAs) contribute to more cancellations than direct bookings?

What are the seasonal patterns in cancellations (month-wise)?

Which market segment and distribution channel are most reliable?

📈 Key Insights

City Hotels face more cancellations than Resort Hotels.

Short lead times (0–60 days) and medium lead times (60–120 days) contribute nearly 50% of cancellations.

Online Travel Agencies (OTA) have the highest cancellation rate.

Summer months (July–August) show peak cancellations.

Corporate bookings show lower cancellation rates compared to OTA bookings.

✅ Recommendations

Implement stricter cancellation policies for short lead-time bookings.

Negotiate better terms with OTAs or promote direct bookings.

Use dynamic pricing for risky customer segments.

Forecast demand by factoring in seasonal cancellation patterns.

Target corporate bookings (low cancellation rates).
